The MOD standards provide guidelines for developing and validating models of the power system. Accurate models are essential for understanding how the system will behave under various conditions and for identifying potential problems before they occur. A good introduction to MOD standards on Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) can be found on [this page](https://www.powereng.com/library/an-introduction-to-completing-nerc-mod-studies-for). MOD standards ask for models in [PSS®E](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/grid-software/planning/pss-software/pss-e.html) or [PSLF](https://www.gevernova.com/consulting/software/pslf), which are for positive sequence Phasor-based analysis. Currently, electromagnetic transient program ([EMPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMTP)) modeling is not required in NERC MOD standards. However, NERC published this [white paper](https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC_Reliability_Guidelines/Reliability_Guideline-EMT_Modeling_and_Simulations.pdf) in March 2023 points out that \"__conventional fundamental frequency, positive-sequence dynamic simulation tools used Transmission Planners and Planning Coordinators for many years are inadequate for effectively identifying reliability risks of inverter-based resources in some ways. Electromagnetic transient simulations are necessary to adequately identify and mitigate Bulk Power System reliability risks moving forward.__\" \n\n## PSS®E vs. PSCAD\n\nPSS®E and PSCAD represent two kinds of power system simulation software. The former is for [positive-sequence simulation](https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC_Reliability_Guidelines/Beyond_Positive_Sequence_Technical_Report.pdf) operating in the Root Mean square (RMS) domain, and the latter is for Electromagnetic Transient ([EMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMTP)) simulation. As shown in @tbl-powersimsw there are popular commercial packages for the aforementioned two kinds of simulations.\n\n::: {#tbl-powersimsw .cell tbl-cap='Power System Simulation Softwares' execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=1}\nName          Positive-sequence Dynamic Simulation    Electromagnetic Transient Simulation    Owner\n------------  --------------------------------------  --------------------------------------  ---------------------------------\nPSS®E         ✓                                       ❌                                      Siemens\nPSLF          ✓                                       ❌                                      GE\nPowerFactory  ✓                                       ✓                                       DIgSILENT\nETAP          ❌                                      ✓                                       Schneider\nPSCAD         ❌                                      ✓                                       Manitoba Hydro International Ltd.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-PSSimulationMarket is from [ABB Grid Code Compliance](https://new.abb.com/power-electronics/excitation-and-synchronization/grid-code-compliance) which shows the market leader in different regions around the world. There are also, a lot of open source simulation packages out there.\n\n![Power system simulation software market](img/PowerSystemSimulationSoftware.png){#fig-PSSimulationMarket width=6.5in}\n\n## Inverter EMT Stuidies\nThe NERC [white paper](https://www.nerc.com/comm/RSTC_Reliability_Guidelines/Reliability_Guideline-EMT_Modeling_and_Simulations.pdf) emphasizes that \"__the need for EMT studies to assess [BPS](https://www.wecc.org/epubs/StateoftheInterconnection/Pages/The-Bulk-Power-System.aspx) reliability is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years based on planned projects in the interconnection queues. Industry will need to act quickly to develop the skills, processes, tools, infrastructure, and capabilities to perform these studies effectively and efficiently.__\"\n\nProjects in the queue are mainly solar and Battery Energy Storage Systems. ([BESS](https://electrification.us.abb.com/battery-energy-storage-systems-bess-basics)) Here is a list of studies that need EMT simulation:\n\n* Inverter weak grid integration\n* Sub-synchronous control interaction\n* Controls interactions between inverters\n* Inverter ride-through performance evaluation\n* Inverter short-circuit current analysis\n* Power quality studies\n* Black start studies\n* IEEE 2800-2022 performance compliance\n\n## EMTP/PSCAD modeling guideline\n\nERCOT [Dynamics Working Group](https://www.ercot.com/committees/ros/dwg) Procedure Manual gives a detailed guide on what and how the inverter PSCAD model should be build, tested and validated.\n\n[Electranix](https://www.electranix.com/) also publish PSCAD Requirements which are well accepted by NERC in the North America region.\n\n",
