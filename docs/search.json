The result unveils an interesting and important feature of three-phase grid-tied inverters - namely, that its q-q channel impedance behaves as a negative incremental resistor. Moreover, this paper shows that this behavior is a consequence of grid synchronization, where the bandwidth of the PLL determines the frequency range of the resistor behavior, and the power rating of the inverter determines the magnitude of the resistor. Advanced PLL, current, and power control strategies do not change this feature.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nSmall-signal stability is of great concern for electrical power systems with a large number of regulated power converters. In the case of dc systems, stability can be predicted by examining the locus described by the ratio of the source and load impedances in the complex plane per the Nyquist stability criterion. For balanced three-phase ac systems the same impedance-based method applies, for which this paper uses impedances in the synchronous rotating reference (d-q) frame. Small-signal stability can be determined by applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC). This approach relies on the actual measurement of these impedances, which up to now has severely hindered its applicability. Addressing this shortcoming, this paper investigates the small-signal stability of a three-phase ac system using measured d-q frame impedances. The results obtained show how the stability at the ac interface can be easily and readily predicted using the measured impedances and the GNC, thus illustrating the practicality of the approach, and validating the use of ac impedances as a valuable dynamic analysis tool for ac system integration, in perfect dualism with the dc case.\n\n\n\nFig.1 GNC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{wen2014,\n  author = {Wen, Bo},\n  title = {Small-Signal {Stability} {Analysis} of {Three-Phase} {AC}\n    {Systems} in the {Presence} of {Constant} {Power} {Loads} {Based} on\n    {Measured} d-q {Frame} {Impedances}},\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics},\n  date = {2014-12-04},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6975228},\n  doi = {10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWen, Bo. 2014. “Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC\nSystems in the Presence of Constant Power Loads Based on Measured d-q\nFrame Impedances.” IEEE Transactions on Power\nElectronics, December. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731."

    "section": "IBR-related Reliability Gaps",
    "text": "IBR-related Reliability Gaps\n\nData Sharing:\n\nThe currently effective Reliability Standards do not require data that accurately represents IBRs to be provided to planning coordinators, transmission planners, reliability coordinators, transmission operators, and balancing authorities. Examples of needed data may include location, capacity, telemetry, steady-state, dynamic, and short-circuit modeling information, control settings, ramp rates, equipment status, and disturbance analysis data.\nReliability Standard MOD-032-1 does not require generator owners to submit registered IBR-specific modeling data and parameters such as control setting for momentary cessation and ramp rates, which are necessary for modeling steady and dynamic registered IBR performance for purposes of planning the Bulk-Power System (BPS).\nReliability Standard TOP-003-5 does not require generator owners to submit registered IBR-specific modeling data and parameters to their transmission operators or balancing authorities.\nCurrent effective Reliability Standards do not ensure that BPS planners and operators receive disturbance monitoring data regarding all generation resources capable of having a material impact on the reliable operation of the BPS, including registered IBR. Such data is needed to adequately assess disturbance events and the behavior of IBRs during those events. (Can IBR monitor the data and report?)\nCurrent effective Reliability Standards do not require Bulk-Power-System planners and operators to receive modeling data and parameters regarding unregistered IBRs. BPS planners and operators do not currently have the data to accurately model the behavior of registered and unregistered IBRs, and IBR-DERs for steady-state, dynamic, and short-circuit studies.\n\nData and Model Validation\n\nThe currently effective Reliability Standards do not require the use of NERC’s approved (in 2015) component models. The user-defined models in system models can be problematic.\nCurrent effective Reliability Standards MOD-026-1 and MOD-027-1 do not require a generator owner to provide verified models and data for IBR-specific controls to its transmission planner.\nCurrent Reliability Standards neither require the transmission owner for unregistered IBRs to provide verified dynamic models nor require distribution providers to provide verified dynamic models of IBR-DERs.\nCurrent effective Reliability Standards neither require IBR-DERs in the aggregate to submit the respective dynamic models to the applicable registered entities that perform planning and operations functions.\nCurrent Reliability Standard MOD-033-2 requires validation using real-world data of the interconnection-wide model, the current effective Reliability Standards lack clarity as to whether models of registered IBRs, unregistered IBRs, and IBR-DERs in the aggregate are required to represent the real-world behavior of the equipment installed.\nCurrent Reliability Standards do not require that any changes to IBR settings, configurations, and ratings are updated.\nNERC annually assesses the interconnection-wide model quality and publishes a report to help entities responsible for complying with Reliability Standard MOD-032 to resolve model issues and improve the cases. NERC’s 2021 Case Quality Metrics Assessment indicates that planners are not able to develop accurate system models. All interconnections demonstrate either a consistent performance or a worsening score in the unacceptable or not recommended model metrics.\nReliability Standards MOD-032-1 and MOD-033-2 do not require the applicable entities to work collaboratively to create interconnection-wide models that accurately reflect the real-world interconnection-wide performance and behavior of registered and unregistered IBRs individually and in the aggregate, as well as IBR-DERs in aggregate.\n\nPerformance Requirements\n\nCurrent Reliability Standards do not account for the differences in the response of registered IBRs and synchronous generation resources during normal and contingency conditions.\nReliability Standard PRC-024-3 does not require registered IBRs (or any generator) to remain connected to the BPS and to continue to inject current and support frequency inside the “no trip zone.” Therefore, IBRs could continue to act adversely in response to normally cleared faults by continuing to exhibit momentary cessation and power reduction behaviors.\nCurrent Reliability Standards do not require registered IBRs to continually inject current and support voltage inside the “no trip zone” during a voltage excursion. The Reliability Standards also do not contain voltage ride-through performance requirements that address the unique protection and control functions of registered IBRs that can cause tripping and momentary cessation, even when the IBR voltage protection settings comply with Reliability Standard PRC-024-3.\nCurrent Reliability Standards do not require all generation resources that momentarily cease operation following a system disturbance to return to pre-disturbance output levels without impeded ramp rates or require that all generation resources maintain voltage phase angle synchronization with the BPS grid voltage during a system disturbance. Such momentary cessation occurrences exacerbate system disturbances and have a material impact on the reliable operation of the BPS."

The try-and-error method of operating IBRs in the grid starts reaching its limit while the grid is retiring synchronous generators. I am well aware of IEEE-1547 and IBR control and stability analysis, however, I was shocked that in the past decade, our grid has been planned and operated without using IBR data and models. For a power electronics engineer, it’s like controlling your converter with a feedback loop’s PI parameters set by guessing. Now, we need to study the system carefully to derive our plant transfer function (model) validate it with measurement and design the system with a good amount of stability margin! However, the power system is more complicated than a single converter!"

When an SSR happens, it can be observed that the synchronous generator embeds a “parasitic” induction generator. If the stator “sees” a rotor turning at a frequency above the synchronous one, then the slip is negative and the equivalent circuit exhibits a negative resistance. At high degrees of compensation, this apparent negative resistance may exceed the network resistance, effectively resulting in an RLC circuit with negative resistance. Such a condition will result in self-excitation causing electrical oscillations of intolerable levels."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nSmall-signal stability in balanced three-phase systems is typically investigated by means of the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC) that involves operations on the source and load subsystems’ impedance matrices. Eigenvalues of the ratio of these impedance matrices should be calculated for stability judgment. This paper shows that for a power-electronics-based distributed power system, impedance matrices of subsystems can be designed as diagonal dominant. Therefore, stability, in this case, is fully determined by the scalar ratios formed by the impedance elements seen across the d-axis and q-axis interfaces. A three-phase ac system can then be treated as two decoupled dc systems. As a result, the ac stability analysis can also be conducted based on insightful impedance quantities; impedance specification criteria developed for dc systems can be readily applied to ensure stability in ac systems. The major contribution of this paper is related to the simplification of the GNC analysis with good experimental validations. Limitation of the proposed method is that the systems have to work under high power factor condition. However, such limitation is not a problem for many power-electronics-based distributed power systems.\n\n\n\nFig.1 Multi Converter System\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{wen2017,\n  author = {Wen, Bo},\n  title = {AC {Stability} {Analysis} and Dq {Frame} {Impedance}\n    {Specifications} in {Power-Electronics-Based} {Distributed} {Power}\n    {Systems}},\n  journal = {IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power\n    Electronics},\n  date = {2017-07-18},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7983362},\n  doi = {10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2728640},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWen, Bo. 2017. “AC Stability Analysis and Dq Frame Impedance\nSpecifications in Power-Electronics-Based Distributed Power\nSystems.” IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in\nPower Electronics, July. https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2728640."

Three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs) are being installed more and more in the grid to improve efficiency or to utilize renewable energy sources. The same stability issues between VSCs are also reported and analyzed using a small-signal model of phase-locked loops (PLLs). This paper proposes a different impedance-based analysis method. The proposed method shows that synchronization instability in a VSC system is due to the negative incremental resistance behavior of grid-tied inverters’ impedance when they are modeled in the d-q frame. System can be stabilized simply by changing the inverter’s PLL design. Experimental results verify the analysis and the proposed method.\n\n\n\nFig.1 Synchronization Instability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{wen2015,\n  author = {Wen, Bo},\n  title = {Impedance-Based {Analysis} of {Grid-Synchronization}\n    {Stability} for {Three-Phase} {Paralleled} {Converters}},\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics},\n  date = {2015-04-03},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7079502},\n  doi = {10.1109/TPEL.2015.2419712},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWen, Bo. 2015. “Impedance-Based Analysis of Grid-Synchronization\nStability for Three-Phase Paralleled Converters.” IEEE\nTransactions on Power Electronics, April. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2419712."
