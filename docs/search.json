    "text": "Abstract:\nSmall-signal stability in balanced three-phase systems is typically investigated by means of the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC) that involves operations on the source and load subsystems’ impedance matrices. Eigenvalues of the ratio of these impedance matrices should be calculated for stability judgment. This paper shows that for a power-electronics-based distributed power system, impedance matrices of subsystems can be designed as diagonal dominant. Therefore, stability, in this case, is fully determined by the scalar ratios formed by the impedance elements seen across the d-axis and q-axis interfaces. A three-phase ac system can then be treated as two decoupled dc systems. As a result, the ac stability analysis can also be conducted based on insightful impedance quantities; impedance specification criteria developed for dc systems can be readily applied to ensure stability in ac systems. The major contribution of this paper is related to the simplification of the GNC analysis with good experimental validations. Limitation of the proposed method is that the systems have to work under high power factor condition. However, such limitation is not a problem for many power-electronics-based distributed power systems.\n\n\n\nFig.1 Multi Converter System\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{wen2017,\n  author = {Wen, Bo},\n  title = {AC {Stability} {Analysis} and Dq {Frame} {Impedance}\n    {Specifications} in {Power-Electronics-Based} {Distributed} {Power}\n    {Systems}},\n  journal = {IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power\n    Electronics},\n  date = {2017-07-18},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7983362},\n  doi = {10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2728640},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWen, Bo. 2017. “AC Stability Analysis and Dq Frame Impedance\nSpecifications in Power-Electronics-Based Distributed Power\nSystems.” IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in\nPower Electronics, July. https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2017.2728640."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\nSmall-signal stability is of great concern for electrical power systems with a large number of regulated power converters. In the case of dc systems, stability can be predicted by examining the locus described by the ratio of the source and load impedances in the complex plane per the Nyquist stability criterion. For balanced three-phase ac systems the same impedance-based method applies, for which this paper uses impedances in the synchronous rotating reference (d-q) frame. Small-signal stability can be determined by applying the generalized Nyquist stability criterion (GNC). This approach relies on the actual measurement of these impedances, which up to now has severely hindered its applicability. Addressing this shortcoming, this paper investigates the small-signal stability of a three-phase ac system using measured d-q frame impedances. The results obtained show how the stability at the ac interface can be easily and readily predicted using the measured impedances and the GNC, thus illustrating the practicality of the approach, and validating the use of ac impedances as a valuable dynamic analysis tool for ac system integration, in perfect dualism with the dc case.\n\n\n\nFig.1 GNC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@article{wen2014,\n  author = {Wen, Bo},\n  title = {Small-Signal {Stability} {Analysis} of {Three-Phase} {AC}\n    {Systems} in the {Presence} of {Constant} {Power} {Loads} {Based} on\n    {Measured} d-q {Frame} {Impedances}},\n  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics},\n  date = {2014-12-04},\n  url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6975228},\n  doi = {10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nWen, Bo. 2014. “Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC\nSystems in the Presence of Constant Power Loads Based on Measured d-q\nFrame Impedances.” IEEE Transactions on Power\nElectronics, December. https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2378731."

    "text": "Abstract:\nGrid synchronization stability issues and subsynchronous oscillations between synchronous generators exist in electrical power systems. Three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs) are being installed more and more in the grid to improve efficiency or to utilize renewable energy sources. The same stability issues between VSCs are also reported and analyzed using a small-signal model of phase-locked loops (PLLs). This paper proposes a different impedance-based analysis method. The proposed method shows that synchronization instability in a VSC system is due to the negative incremental resistance behavior of grid-tied inverters’ impedance when they are modeled in the d-q frame. System can be stabilized simply by changing the inverter’s PLL design.

The result unveils an interesting and important feature of three-phase grid-tied inverters - namely, that its q-q channel impedance behaves as a negative incremental resistor. Moreover, this paper shows that this behavior is a consequence of grid synchronization, where the bandwidth of the PLL determines the frequency range of the resistor behavior, and the power rating of the inverter determines the magnitude of the resistor. Advanced PLL, current, and power control strategies do not change this feature. An example shows that under weak grid conditions, a change of the PLL bandwidth could lead the inverter system to unstable conditions as a result of this behavior.
